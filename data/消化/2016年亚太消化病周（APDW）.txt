Dear Colleagues,
On behalf of the organizing committee of APDW 2016, we are pleased to inform you that this event is going to be held at the Kobe Convention Center, Hyogo, Japan, on November 2-5, 2016.
APDW 2016 Kobe is to be hosted by the organization of Japan Digestive Disease Week (JDDW), which consists of the four associations: the Japanese Society of Gastroenterology (JSGE), the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society (JGES), the Japan Society of Hepatology (JSH), and the Japanese Society of Gastroenterological Surgery (JSGS). JDDW, which draws over 20,000 attendees every year, is to be co-hosted with APDW 2016 at the same venue. APDW 2016 participants can attend JDDW2016 with the same registrations. Since JDDW 2016 includes a wide variety of international sessions in English, we are confident that overseas participants of APDW 2016 will find it worthwhile to attend JDDW 2016, as well. This four-day-event provides you an invaluable opportunity to enrich cross-border relations.
The theme of APDW 2016 is "Innovative Approaches to Gastroenterology," and the programs are designed to offer cutting-edge and futuristic perspectives, not to mention being informative and educative.
Specifically, the following lectures are planned:
Stem Cell Research in Gastroenterology
iPS Research in Gastroenterology
Gut Microbiota in Health and Disease
Cancer Epigenetics: Above and Beyond
Advanced Imaging Technology in Endoscopy
Neurogastroenterology and Motility
Insulin Resistance and the Liver
Innovation of Robotic Surgery in Gastroenterology
We strongly assure you the Kobe Congress must be an ideal platform to exchange knowledge on innovations and advances that address current issues in the treatment of digestive diseases.
Kobe is an attractive international port city with a long history of playing host to multi-cultural residents and visitors. It has a large international convention center, ample options for accommodation, and a number of international flights to and from the nearby Kansai International Airport (KIX) with convenient transportation links to Kobe.
Kobe is famous not only for Kobe beef but also for its abundant supply of fresh seafood from the beautiful Inland Sea of Japan or Setonaikai. Thanks to Kobe’s convenient location, conference attendees are able to enjoy daytrips to popular sightseeing spots such as Himeji Castle, the world heritage site, and such big cities as Kyoto, Osaka, Nara, and Hiroshima. A ride on the bullet train will take you from Kobe to Tokyo in just three hours!
We cordially invite you to come and join us for JDDW2016 as well as APDW2016 in Kobe to share and broaden your understanding in the gastroenterological field. You can experience Japanese hospitality at its courteous and gracious best. We are prepared to do everything possible to make sure your experience to be unforgettable and valuable.
Best regards,
